/*
INPUT
There will be no input in this test problem. So no need to use any scanf-related function
to get an input.

OUTPUT
You need to output only a line that says “Hello World!” (without the quotes). 
Please look below for the sample output. REMEMBER! If you output unnecessary character(s), 
the system will give you “Wrong Answer” instead of “Correct”.

Sample Output (standard output)
Hello World!
